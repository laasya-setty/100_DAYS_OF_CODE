----------------------
| Child c=new Child() |
----------------------
-> can access both parent and child class variables and methods.

Upcasting
------------------------
| Parent p=new Child();  |
------------------------
->This statment means that, parent object is referencing to child object.
->this parent object can now access i)its own method and variables, and if the method is overridden by child class then it gives overridden method(in child) as output.
                                    ii)cannot access variables and methods in child class ,can access only which are overridden.
  
 Downcasting
 -----------------------
| Parent p=new Child()  |
| Child c=(Child)p;     |
-------------------------
-> Downcasting throws a error in Java generally, so we do dwencasting explicitly using above given syntax
->The last statment say that,the child object c is referencing to parent object p explicitly where p is referencing to child(in first statment).
->c can access both variables and methods from parent class which are not overridden.
->if any of the methods or variables are ovverriden then it uses that.
-> Can access its own methods(child) and variables.
